# Chapter 2

protons - positively charged, and about the same mass as neurons
- neutral, they are uncharged.
electrons - negatively charged and are very low in mass. 

The number of protons determines an element's atomic number. 
The number of protons and neutrons determines an element's mass number. 
atomic mass ( measured by protons + neutrons ).

Isotopes are different forms of an element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. 

Electron shells are labeled as K,L,M,N,O,P, and Q; or 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. 
Going from the innermost shell to the outermost shell. Electrons in the outer shell have higher average energy and travel farther from the nucleus than those in the inner shells. 

electron configuration is the summary of where the electrons are around a nucleus.

cations are positively charged ions that form by losing electrons.
anions are negatively charged ions that form by gaining electrons.

ionic bonds form between ions with opposite charges.

octet rule refers to the tendency of atoms to prefer to have eight electrons in the valence shells. 

the valence shell is the outermost shell of an atom containing valence electrons.

the covalent bond allows atoms to satisfy the octet rule by sharing electrons. Covalent bonds are more common than iconic bonds.
These covalent bonds may share one, two, or three pairs of electrons. Making single, double, or triple bonds, respectively. The more bonds the stronger their connection becomes. 

Polar Covalent bonds are bonds where atoms unequally share the electrons. Which are attracted to one nucleus more than the other.

Non-Polar Covalent bonds occur when atoms share electrons equally. 

The hydrogen bond is a weak bond between two molecules resulting from electrostatic attraction between a proton in one molecule and an electronegative atom in the other.

van der Waals interactions are weak interactions and occur relative to slight fluctuations of the electron densities.

water's polarity creates a slightly positive charge on hydrogen and a slightly negative charge on oxygen, contributing to water's properties of attrition. 

Polar substances that interact readily with or dissolve in water are known as hydrophilic (water-loving). 
nonpolar molecules such as oil and fats that do not interact well with water are known as hydrophobic ( water-fearing ).

Water has the highest specific heat capacity of any liquids. This means that the amount of heat one gram of a substance must absorb or lose to change its temperature by one degree Celsius. 

Water has a high heat of vaporization, the amount of energy required to change one gram of a liquid substance to a gas. 

Water can stay in glass because of cohesion. Cohesion describes how water molecules are attracted to each other ( due to hydrogen bonding ), keeping the molecules together in the liquid-gas (water-air) interface. 

Acid is a substance that increases hydrogen ions concentration in a solution.
A base provides either hydroxide ions or negatively charged ions that are combined with hydrogen ions, reducing their concentration in the solution and thereby raising the pH. 

Buffers readily absorb excess hydrogen or hydroxide, keeping the body's pH carefully maintained in the narrow range required for survival. 

Macromolecules are a subset of organic molecules ( any carbon-containing liquid, solid, or gas ).

The suffixes "-ane", "-ene", and "-yne" refer to the presence of a single, double, or triple carbon-carbon bond.

Isomers are molecules that share the same chemical formula, but, have different placements of atoms and/or chemical bonds. 

Structural isomers differ in the placement of their covalent bonds: both molecules have four carbons and ten hydrogen bonds, but, have different arrangements within the molecules leading to differences in their chemical properties. 

Geometric isomers, have similar placement of their covalent bonds but differ in how these bonds are made to the surrounding atoms. In the simple molecule butene(C4H8) the two methyl groups (CH3) can be on either side of the double covalent bond central to the molecule. 

Enantiomers are molecules that share the same chemical structure and chemical bonds but differ in the three-dimensional placement of atoms.

Functional groups are groups of atoms that occur within molecules and confer specific chemical properties to those molecules. We find them along the "carbon backbone" of macromolecules.

# Chapter 4 Cell Structure
A cell is a small unit of living things. Whether composed of one cell or many, we refer to them as organisms. Thus, cells are the building blocks of all organisms.
<br>
There are many types of cells, which scientists groups into one of two broad categories: prokaryotic and eukaryotic.
-We classify animal and plant cells as eukaryotic<br>
-We classify bacterial cells as prokaryotic.
<br>
Cells vary in size and we cannot see them with the naked eye, so scientists use microscopes to study them.

# Chapter 5 Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes
The plasma membrane and the cell membrane have many functions. But, the most basic one is to define the cell's border and keep the cell functional. The membrane is permeable meaning that it can allow materials to freely enter or leave the cell. 

The fluid mosaic model has changed over time. But, it is the best account for plasma membranes and function as we understand them in the modern world.

The fluid mosaic model describes the plasma membrane structure as a mosaic of components-including phospholipids, cholesterol, proteins, and carbohydrates- that give the membrane a fluid character.

A cell's plasma membrane defines the cells and outlines its border. Determining the nature of its interaction with its environment.

A plasma membrane's principal components are lipids (phospholipids and cholesterol), protein, and carbohydrates attached to some of the lipids and proteins. 

A phospholipid is a molecule consisting of glycerol, two fatty acids, and a phosphate-linked head group. 

Phospholipids are the main fabric of a membrane and are amphiphilic.

The hydrophilic area of phospholipids is in contact with the aqueous fluid both inside and outside the cell.

The hydrophobic phospholipids tend to be non-polar. They interact with non-polar molecules in chemical reactions, but generally do not interact with polar molecules. 

Polar molecules are molecules in which the electrons between the covalently bonded atoms are not even.

When placed in water, hydrophobic molecules will tend to cluster or group into a ball. However, the hydrophilic regions form hydrogen bonds with water and other polar molecules on both the cell's exterior and interior.

The cell's interior and exterior are hydrophilic. In contrast, the membrane's interior is hydrophobic and will not interact with water. Overall, phospholipids form an excellent two-layer cell membrane that separates the fluids within the cell from the fluid outside the cell.

Integral proteins or integrins are proteins that are permanently embedded within the plasma membrane. They have functions such as channeling or transporting molecules across the membrane. 

Peripheral proteins are on the membranes' exterior and interior surfaces, attached either to integral proteins or to phospholipids. 

Carbohydrates are the third major plasma membrane component. They are always found on the cells' exterior surface and are bound either to proteins or lipids.

Carbohydrates along with proteins form specialized sites on the surface of the cells that allow the cells to recognize foreign cells/tissues from the body cells. 

Passive transport is a naturally occurring phenomenon and does not require the cell to exert any energy to accomplish the movement of cells. 

Diffusion is a passive process of transport. Diffusion occurs when a single substance moves from a high concentration to a low concentration area until the concentration is equal across a space. 

The greater the difference between the level of concentration, the faster the diffusion rate will be. The closer the distribution of the material is to the equilibrium, the slower the diffusion rate will be. 
The heavier the molecules being diffused the slower the diffusion process will be. Heavier molecules move slower. 
Temperature: The higher the temperature the more energy increases therefore the speed of the process does as well. Alternatively, if the temperature was higher then the diffusion processes would become slower. 
Solvent Density: As the density of a solvent increases, the diffusion rate decreases. 

facilitated transport is one way of moving materials without expending cellular energy. This process happens through passive diffusion ( from high concentration to low concentration area).

Osmosis transports only water across a membrane and the membrane limits the solutes' diffusion in the water. 

Tonicity is often correlated with the solution's osmolarity or the solution's total solute concentration. Tonicity describes the capabilities of a solution to modify the volume of cells by altering their water content. 

A hypotonic solution is a solution that has a lower concentration of solute compared to cells.
A hypertonic solution is a solution with a greater concentration of solute compared to cells.
An isotonic solution has the same concentration of solute compared to cells. 

Plasmolysis is the process of contracting or shrinkage of protoplasm in a plant cell caused by a loss of water in the cell. Plasmolysis is a result of osmosis. 

Active Transport mechanisms require the cell's energy to move substances into a cell against the concentration gradient. 

Primary active transport uses ATP to transport all species of solute across a membrane against their concentration gradient.
Secondary active transport moves the substance across the membrane due to ATP, but, is not a direct cause of ATP usage. In a sense, secondary active transport is a side effect. 

Transporters(proteins)
Uniporter carries one specific ion/molecule.
A symporter carries two different ions/molecules.
Antiporter carries two different ions/molecules but in different directions.

Endocytosis is an active transport that moves particles as large as molecules. The cellular process occurs in which substances are brought into the cell and are surrounded by the plasma membrane. 

Phagocytosis is a process in which a cell takes in a large particle, such as other cells or relatively large particles. E.g. When microorganisms invade the human body, a type of white blood cell, a neutrophil, will remove the invaders through this process, surrounding and engulfing the microorganism, which the neutrophil then destroys. 

Pinocytosis occurs when small particles suspended in extracellular fluid are brought into the cell through an invagination of the cell membrane, suspending the particles within a small vesicle inside the cell. 

Exocytosis is the process of moving materials from within a cell to the exterior of the cell.
