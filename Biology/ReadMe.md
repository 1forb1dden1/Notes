protons - positively charged, and about the same mass as neurons
neurons - neutral, they are uncharged.
electrons - negatively charged and are very low in mass. 

The number of protons determins an element's atomic number. 
The number of protons and neurons determine an element's mass number. 
atomic mass ( measured by protons + neutrons ).

Isotopes are different forms of an element that have the same number of protons but different number of neutrons. 

Electron shells are labeled as K,L,M,N,O,P, and Q; or 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. 
Going from the innermost shell to the outermost shell. Electrons in the outer shell have higher average energy and travel farther from the nucelus than those in the inner shells. 

electorn configuration is the summary of where the electrons are around a nucleus.

cations are positively charged ions that form by losing electrons.
anions are negatively charged ions that form by gaining electrons.

ionic bonds form between ions with opposite charges.

octet rule refers to the tendency of atoms to prefer to have eight electrons in the valence shells. 

the valence shell is the outermost shell of an atom containing valence electrons.

covalent bond allows atoms to satisfy the octet rule by sharing electrons. Covalent bonds are more common than iconic bonds.
These covalent bonds may share one, two, or three pairs of electrons. Making single, double, or triple bonds, respectively. The more bonds the stronger their connection becomes. 

Polar Covalent bonds are bonds where atoms unequally share the electrons. Which are attracted to one nucleus more than the other.

Non Polar Covalent bonds occurs when atoms share electrons equally. 

Hydrogen bond is a weak bond between two molecules resulting from electrostatic attraction between a proton in one molecule and an electronegative atom in the other.

van der Waals interactions are weak interactions and occur relative to slight fluctuations of the electron densities.

water's polarity creates a slightly positive charge on hydrogen and a slightly negative charge on oxygen, contributing to water's properties of attrition. 

Polar substances that interacts readily with or dissolves in water is known as hydrophilic ( water loving ). 
nonpolar molecules such as oil and fats that do not interact well with water is known as hydrophobic ( water fearing ).

Water has the highest specific heat capacity of any liquids. This means that the a amoiunt of heat one gram of a substance must absorb or lose to change it's temperature by one degree celsius. 

Water has high heat of vaporization, the amount of energy required to change one gram of liquid subtance to a gas. 

Water can stay in a glass because of cohesion. Cohesion describes how water molecules are attracted to each other ( due to hydrogen bonding ), keeping the molecules together in the liquid-gas (water-air) interface. 

Acid is a substance hte increases hydrogen ions concentration in a solution.
A base provides either hydroxide ions or negative charged ions that combined with hydrogen ions, reducing their concentration in the solution and thereby raising the pH. 

Buffers readily absorb excess hydrogen or hydroxide, keeping the body's pH carefully maintained in the narrow range required for survival. 

Macromolecules are subtset of organic molecules ( any carbon-containing liquid, solid, or gas ).

The suffixes "-ane", "-ene", and "-yne" refer to the presence of a single, double, or triple carbon-carbon bond.

Isomers are the molecules that share the same chemical formula, but, have different placements of atoms and/or chemical bonds. 

Structural isomers differ in the placemnt of their covalent bonds: both molecules have four carbons and ten hydrogen bonds, but, have different arrangements within the molecules leading to differences in their chemical properties. 

Goemtric isomers, have similar placement of their covalent bonds but differ in how these bonds made to the surroudning atoms. In the simple molecule butene(C4H8) the two methyl groups (CH3) can be on either side of the double covalent bond central to the moluecle. 

Enantiomers are molecules that share the same chemical structure and chemical bonds but differ in three-dimensional placement of atoms.

Functional groups are groups of atoms that occur within molecules and confer specific chemical properties to those molecules. We find them along the "carbon backbone" of macromolecules.
